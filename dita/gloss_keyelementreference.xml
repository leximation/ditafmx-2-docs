<glossterm>key element reference</glossterm>
<glossdef>A key element reference refers to content that is defined
within the <synph outputclass = "element">topicmeta</synph> of a <synph
    outputclass = "element">keydef</synph> element. This is not
an industry-defined term, but one created to provide a name in which
to refer to this construct since it does differ from other types
of referenced content in DITA.</glossdef>
