<body status = "changed"><p status = "changed">The <uicontrol
    status = "new">Reference Manager</uicontrol> (displayed when
you choose <menucascade><uicontrol>DITA-FMx</uicontrol><uicontrol>Insert Conref</uicontrol></menucascade>)
allows you to create a content reference (conref or conkeyref) to
elements within the same file or in other files.</p>
<p status = "new">Select a source file from those currently open
or from files in a folder or map (as defined by the <uicontrol
    status = "new">File Location</uicontrol> option). Select the
target element type in the <uicontrol status = "new">Element Tag</uicontrol> list,
then select an item from the <uicontrol status = "new">Element Data</uicontrol> list
to create a conref to that element. Alternatively, you can use the <uicontrol
    status = "new">Key Reference</uicontrol> button to select the
target content based on a key.</p>

<p status = "new">The <uicontrol status = "new">Element Tag</uicontrol> list
displays the names of elements that exist in the source file and
have an <synph status = "new" outputclass = "attribute">id</synph> attribute
value. The <uicontrol status = "new">Element Data</uicontrol> list
displays the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "attribute">id</synph> and
text of the available elements.</p>
<p status = "new">If you are creating a conref range, select the
end element from the <uicontrol status = "new">Conref End</uicontrol> list. Only
elements that follow the selected item in the <uicontrol status = "new">Element
Data</uicontrol> list are available as a conref end element.</p>
<p status = "new"><indexterm status = "new">conkeyref, creating</indexterm>To
create a reference to an element defined by a key (conkeyref), choose
the <uicontrol status = "new">Key Reference</uicontrol> button.
The <uicontrol status = "new">Keyref Manager</uicontrol> dialog
lets you select a key from the specified keyspace, then locate the
required element id. For a conref, you should select both the key
and the element id. Choosing <uicontrol status = "new">OK</uicontrol> in
the <uicontrol status = "new">Keyref Manager</uicontrol> inserts
the &lt;key>/&lt;elemid> into the <uicontrol status = "new">Key
Reference</uicontrol> field.</p>
<p status = "new">The referenced element is inserted at the location
specified. You can double click the conref to re-open the Reference
Manager to change the referenced element or edit the source file.
The Reference Manager also lets you display the list of all elements for
conrefing (even if they have no <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "attribute">id</synph> value), you must provide
the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "attribute">id</synph> value
at insertion time.</p>
<p status = "changed"><indexterm class = "- topic/indexterm ">features<indexterm
class = "- topic/indexterm ">conref support</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm
class = "- topic/indexterm ">conref support features</indexterm>On
the opening of a file, the content of any element included by conref
is resolved and displayed as a locked text range (similar to a text
inset). The color of conrefs is defined by the “DITA-Conref” color
(this is a custom color definition and can be changed in the template).
The auto-loading functionality may be enabled/disabled with the <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol> command.</p>
<p>The <uicontrol>Update References</uicontrol> command provides
an option to load and build the conref elements (if they were not
initially loaded by the auto-load functionality), and update the
conrefs to reflect changes in the source files.</p>
<p status = "changed"><indexterm>convert conref to text</indexterm><indexterm>conref,
convert to text</indexterm>If you want to “break” a conref (make
it into editable text rather than a locked range), select the conref
and choose the <uicontrol status = "new">Flatten Conref</uicontrol> command
(<menucascade status = "new"><uicontrol status = "new">DITA-FMx</uicontrol>
<uicontrol status = "new">FM File Commands</uicontrol>
<uicontrol status = "new">Flatten Conrefs</uicontrol></menucascade>).
To flatten all conrefs in the current file, use the same command,
but place the insertion point away from a conref.</p></body></topic>
