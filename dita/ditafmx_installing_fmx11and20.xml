<title>Switching Between DITA-FMx 1.1 and 2.0</title>
<shortdesc status = "new">Don’t want to completely switch to DITA-FMx
2.0 yet? You can safely install FMx 2.0 along side of FMx 1.1 and
switch back and forth.</shortdesc>

<body status = "new"><p status = "new">DITA-FMx 2.0 installs into
a <filepath status = "new">DITA-FMx-2</filepath> folder in the main
FrameMaker program folder. Because of this, your DITA-FMx 1.1 installation
will be left untouched after installing DITA-FMx 2.0.</p>
<p status = "new">After running the installer, your <filepath
    status = "new">maker.ini</filepath> file will have been updated
to point to the new DITA-FMx 2.0 DLLs. If you’d like to be able
to switch between both DITA-FMx versions, just edit the <filepath
    status = "new">maker.ini</filepath> file as shown below.</p>
<codeblock expanse = "page" status = "new" outputclass = "ini"><coderef href = "code/maker-ini-example.txt" status = "new"/></codeblock>
<p status = "new">The example shown will enable DITA-FMx 2.0. To
switch to DITA-FMx 1.1, just add semicolons in front of the two
“2.0” entries and remove the semicolons in from of the “1.1” entries,
then restart FrameMaker.</p></body></topic>
