<title>Alternate Location for the Structure Applications</title>

<conbody><p status = "new">The structure applications should be
installed to a location that’s writable for the end user. This is
to allow for modifications to be made as needed.</p>
<p status = "new">The following steps describe an option for installing
the structure applications in a more accessible location.</p>
<ol status = "new"><li status = "new"><p status = "new">Select a
writable location for the structure applications.</p><p status = "new">It
doesn’t really matter where you choose, just some place that is
writable by the end user. These instructions will use the path <filepath
    status = "new">C:\FM-apps</filepath>.</p></li>
<li status = "new"><p status = "new">Copy the app files into the
selected folder.</p><p status = "new">Extract the contents of the <filepath
    status = "new">DITA-FMx_apps.zip</filepath> file (found in the <filepath
    status = "new">Program Files\Adobe\FrameMaker\DITA-FMx_2</filepath> folder)
into the <filepath status = "new">FM-apps</filepath> folder. This
will create a folder named <filepath status = "new">DITA-FMx_1.2</filepath> which
contains three folders, <filepath status = "new">Topic</filepath>, <filepath
    status = "new">Map</filepath>, and <filepath status = "new">Book</filepath>.
Each of these three folders contain a “structapps-stub” file specific
to that structure application (<filepath status = "new">structapps-stub_topic_1.2.fm</filepath>, <filepath
    status = "new">structapps-stub_map_1.2.fm</filepath>, and <filepath
    status = "new">structapps-stub_book_1.2.fm</filepath>).</p></li>
<li status = "new"><p status = "new">Modify the path variables in
each of the “structapps-stub” files.</p><p status = "new">Open the <filepath
    status = "new">structapps-stub_topic_1.2.fm</filepath> file
in FrameMaker. You’ll see a number of file references, starting
with the text “$STRUCTDIR,” these are FrameMaker variables. The
goal is to change these to reference the new location for the files. Double-click
the variable, then click the “edit” button in the Variables panel
or dialog (this functionality will vary based on the FrameMaker
version). Change the definition of this variable from “$STRUCTDIR\\xml\\DITA-FMx_1.2\\”
to “C:\\FM-apps\\DITA-FMx_1.2\\” (make the actual value match the
real location). Be sure to use double backslashes and to include
the trailing slashes.</p><p status = "new">Choose “Change” and complete
the process of modifying the variable. You should see that all instances
of this variable have updated to use the new path.</p><p status = "new">Do
the same thing for the Map and Book “structapps-stub” files.</p></li>
<li status = "new"><p status = "new">Follow the instructions for
manually installing the structure applications. </p><p status = "new">See, <xref
href = "ditafmx_installing_apps_manual.xml#id078AAC00PY42" type
= "topic" format = "dita" scope = "local" status = "new"></xref>.
Start with step #3, and in step #5 navigate to the “structapps-stub”
files in the folders you just set up.</p></li></ol>
<note type = "important" status = "new">If you have already installed
the structure applications to the default location, you should remove
the entries in the structure application definitions file that reference
those applications. You can only have one application definition
for a named application.</note></conbody></concept>
