applications provided with DITA-FMx.</p>
<note status = "new">If you’re installing on a system where the

copy of your current structure application definitions file (typically
found at <filepath>FrameMaker\Structure\structapps.fm</filepath> for
FM7.2 and FM8, or <filepath>&lt;user appdata>\Adobe\FrameMaker\&lt;version></filepath> for
FM9 and later). Store this file in a safe location before making
modifications.</p></li>

the contents of the <filepath>DITA-FMx_apps.zip</filepath> file
to the <filepath>FrameMaker\Structure\xml</filepath> folder. This
will create a folder named <filepath status = "changed">DITA-FMx_1.2</filepath> that
contains folders named <filepath>Book</filepath>, <filepath
    status = "changed">dtd-fmx</filepath>, <filepath>Map</filepath>,

files area).</p></li>

the Structure View window (for FM7.2 or FM8 click the <image href="images/structview-btn.png"

<uicontrol status = "new">Structure View</uicontrol></menucascade>).
In the structure application definitions file place the insertion
point just after the Version element. When the insertion point is
in the right location, you’ll see a black triangle pointing to the
right in the Structure View window (see the following image).</p><fig

created in step <xref href = "#id078AAC00PY42/CEGCFEJA" outputclass

Topic Application, <uicontrol status = "changed">DITA-FMx-Map-1.2</uicontrol> for the
DITA Map Application, and <uicontrol status = "changed">DITA-FMx-Book-1.2</uicontrol> for
the DITA Book Application.</p></li></ol>
<note>If your folder structure is non-standard, you may need to
modify the paths specified in the “structapps-stub” files to match
the file paths on your system. To do this, just open the structure
application definitions file and double-click each application’s
text inset. In the dialog that displays, choose the Open Source
button and make the changes in the “stub” file. When you have finished
editing the stub file, save and close that file, then double-click
the text inset again and choose the Update Now button.</note>
<p>If you plan to make use of the DITA Open Toolkit for generating
output, see <xref href = "ditafmx_installing_genoutput.xml#id_067EF01A0YZ"
