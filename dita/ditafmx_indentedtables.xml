<body status = "new"><p status = "new">Unfortunately, FrameMaker
does not provide any way to control the indenting of tables other
than by setting a left indent value for all tables of a particular
format. While you could have a special format for tables in lists,
this may quickly become unreasonable to manage.</p>
<p status = "new">DITA-FMx provides an option (in the Authoring
Options dialog), to automatically set the left indent for tables,
based on the Left Indent property of the parent elementâ€™s paragraph
tag. When a table is used in a standard list, the parent element
will be the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">li</synph> element.</p>
<p status = "new">The indent is applied on file save (as well as
on file open). After inserting a table in a list, save the document
and the table will be indented to match the parent.</p></body></topic>
