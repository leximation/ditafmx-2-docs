are three variables that can be used in this field, %ZIPLISTFILE%, %ZIPFILE%,

is replaced with the path and file name of the archive file name.
The string “%CURDIR%” is replaced with the path to the current file.</p><p

before the command line is executed, the current directory is set
to DITA-FMx installation folder (typically in the Program Files area).
Any commands you place in this field should be designed to run from
that folder.</p><p>The default command line syntax is the following.</p><p><codeph>more
%ZIPLISTFILE% | ditafmx-zip.exe -@ %ZIPFILE%</codeph></p><p>This
command syntax passes the content of the archive file list (%ZIPLISTFILE%)
to the ditafmx-zip utility (the -@ option tells the utility to read
from “stdin”). It then generates the archive file specified by the
%ZIPFILE% variable.</p><p><note conref = "ditafmx_ref_createarchive.xml#id08C8E60035Z/id4de0563c-dac4-4e17-aa76-6356b853ab27"
