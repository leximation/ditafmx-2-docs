<body status = "changed"><p status = "new">DITA-FMx provides a number
of methods for controlling the appearance of tables. You can’t just
apply ad-hoc formatting to a table and expect it to “stick”, but
with a little planning and setup, you should be able to achieve
most of the formatting that you want.</p>
<p status = "new">General table formatting is accomplished by assigning
a FrameMaker table format. Custom ruling and shading can also be
achieved by setting up the template’s reference page with representative
examples of the custom formatting. By default, tables are rendered
to fill the full width of the text column, but can be adjusted.
Rotated table cells will round-trip without any special effort.
If you make use of specialized elements based on the simpletable
element, you’ll need to provide information about those structures
in order for them to operate properly.</p></body></topic>
