<p status = "new">With the “auto-load topicrefs” option enabled
(in DITA Options), when authoring a map, a clickable label is provided
for each topicref-based element. For topicrefs that have a <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">navtitle</synph> element,
the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">navtitle</synph> itself
becomes that clickable label; if no <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">navtitle</synph> is present, an <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph> element
is added as a temporary label. These are used as navigation aids
for accessing topics referenced by a map structure.</p>

Navtitle to Topicref</dt>
<dd status = "new"><ul status = "new"><li><p status = "new"><b
    status = "new">Never Add</b> - Just as it says; with this option
enabled, navtitles are never added unless you specifically add them.</p></li>
<li status = "new"><p status = "new"><b status = "new">Add on Topicref
Insertion</b> - When a topicref-based element is added to a map,
the title of the associated file is added within the <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">navtitle</synph> and <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">topicmeta</synph> elements.
However, when a map is opened that has topicrefs without <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">navtitle</synph> elements,
the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph> element
is used as a label.</p></li>
<li status = "new"><p status = "new"><b status = "new">Add on Topicref
Insertion and Topicref Update</b> - In addition to navtitles being
added on topicref insertion, when a map is opened, any topicrefs without
a <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">navtitle</synph> will
be updated to include the topicmeta/navtitle structure.</p></li></ul></dd></dlentry></dl>
<note type = "important" status = "new"><p status = "new">Use of
the “Add on Topicref Insertion and Topicref Update” option will cause
topicmeta/navtitle structures to be added to all topicrefs in a
map when it is opened and saved.</p></note></body></topic>
