<body><p>Before modifying a topic or referenced element (an element
used as a conref), it may be useful to know all of the files that
reference that topic or element.</p>
<fig audience = "web"><title>DITA-FMx Where Used dialog box</title><image
href="images/whereused.png" align="left" placement="break"  otherprops
= "fmdpi:110"/></fig>
<p status = "changed">In the Where Used dialog, select the option
to indicate the type of reference to locate (element or topic).
If the insertion point is in an element that has an ID, both options are
available, otherwise only the topic option can be used. Specify
the scope as a DITA map or a folder. If you specify a map, the report
will be generated based on all files referenced by that map (and
any submaps). If you specify a folder, the report will be generated
based on all files of the type specified in that file system path.</p>
<note>In order to use the Where Used command to work properly for
a selected element, the element with the ID value must be selected.
This may be obvious in most cases, but if your conref source contains
a child element, you need to make sure the insertion point is in
the parent element not the child.</note>
<p>The context menu (right-click) includes a Where Used menu item
for quick access.</p></body></topic>
