<body><p status = "new"><indexterm>elements<indexterm>fm-reflabel</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm
status = "new">fm-reflabel element</indexterm>In order to provide
a clickable label for some of the topic referencing elements in map
and bookmap files, the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph> element
must be added to the EDD. This element is discarded on file save,
and is recreated on file open.</p>
<p status = "changed">To implement this feature the <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph> element
definition must be added to the EDD and added to the general rule
of the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">topicref</synph>, <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">chapter</synph>, <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">appendix</synph>, <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">part</synph>, etc. elements.
The <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph> element
should have a general rule of “&lt;TEXT>”. If you want to apply
character formatting you can add text format rules.</p>
<p status = "changed">Because the <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph> element is not part
of the DITA specification, it must be deleted on file save. Add
the following rule to the Map application rules file:</p>
<codeblock>fm element "fm-reflabel" drop;</codeblock>
<p>If this element is not added to the EDD, you will be able to
create topic referencing elements, but they will have no label to
click on.</p>
<p status = "new">For maps based on the DITA 1.2 model, most of
the topic referencing elements will use the <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">navtitle</synph> element instead of
the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph> element,
however, the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">keydef</synph> element
does need a clickable label so uses <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph>.</p>
<p status = "changed">The <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph> element
should be added only to Map application.</p>
<note status = "changed"><indexterm>elements<indexterm>fm-topicreflabel</indexterm></indexterm>The <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph> element
replaces the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-topicreflabel</synph> as
of DITA-FMx 1.1. This change was made to support a clickable label
on all topic referencing bookmap elements. When migrating FM-DITA
applications, you’ll want to change <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">fm-topicreflabel</synph> to <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-reflabel</synph>.</note></body></topic>
