<body><p status = "changed">The Book application is essentially
identical to the Topic application except that it has three additional
elements that are used to isolate the separate pieces that are part of
the book. The Book application also makes use of special <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-tabletitle</synph> and <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-figuretitle</synph> elements
for proper table formatting.</p>
<dl status = "changed"><dlentry><dt>fm-ditabook</dt>
<dd status = "changed"><indexterm>fm-ditabook element</indexterm><indexterm>elements<indexterm>fm-ditabook</indexterm></indexterm>The
root element of the generated book file. Also represents the root
DITA map used to create the book. The href attribute defines the
path and name of the source ditamap file. Additional attributes
may be added from map metadata for use as variables or by element
definition context rules.</dd></dlentry>
<dlentry><dt>fm-ditafile</dt>
<dd><indexterm>fm-ditafile element</indexterm><indexterm>elements<indexterm>fm-ditafile</indexterm></indexterm>Identifies
each DITA topic file. The href attribute defines the path and name
of the source topic file. The maptype attribute contains the name
of the element that referenced this topic file in the original ditamap.
This is used by the book-build process to identify specific book
components to automatically apply templates as well as numbering
and pagination properties.</dd></dlentry>
<dlentry><dt>fm-bookcomponent</dt>
<dd><indexterm>fm-bookcomponent element</indexterm><indexterm>elements<indexterm>fm-bookcomponent</indexterm></indexterm>Used
as a container for generated book components. This wraps any generated that
are added by the book-build process, or you can add this for any
generated files you add manually.</dd></dlentry>
<dlentry><dt status = "changed">fm-tabletitle</dt>
<dd status = "changed"><indexterm>fm-tabletitle element</indexterm><indexterm>elements<indexterm>fm-tabletitle</indexterm></indexterm>Allows
for properly formatted table titles in generated FrameMaker files.
The Book application must have the fm-tabletitle element defined
and valid as a child of the tgroup element.</dd></dlentry>
<dlentry><dt status = "changed">fm-figuretitle</dt>
<dd status = "changed"><indexterm>fm-figuretitle element</indexterm><indexterm>elements<indexterm>fm-figuretitle</indexterm></indexterm>Supports <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-xref</synph> references
to “moved” figure titles in generated FrameMaker files. The Book
application must have the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-figuretitle</synph> element defined
and valid as the last child of the fig element. If this element
is not defined, the “move figure titles” book-build option will
use the default title element, but in order to support cross-references
to figure titles that are moved, this element must be defined and
have its @id attribute’s type set to “UniqueID.”</dd></dlentry>
<dlentry><dt status = "changed">fm-figuredesc</dt>
<dd status = "changed"><indexterm>fm-figuredesc element</indexterm><indexterm>elements<indexterm>fm-figuredesc</indexterm></indexterm>Supports
content in a <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">desc</synph> element
that is “moved” with figure titles in generated FrameMaker files.
The Book application must have the <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">fm-figuredesc</synph> element defined
and valid as the last child of the fig element. If this element
is not defined, the “move figure titles” book-build option will
create this element.</dd></dlentry></dl>
<p>Other than these special “fm-*” elements that are unique to the
Book application, three element definitions vary from those in the
Topic application:</p>
<dl><dlentry><dt>title</dt>
<dd>The context rule level numbering differs to allow for an additional
level of “chapter titles.”</dd></dlentry>
<dlentry><dt>fig</dt>
<dd status = "changed">Includes the <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">title</synph> and <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">fm-figuretitle</synph> elements as optional
elements at the end of the general rule. This is required by the
“Move fig/title to end of fig element” Book Build option.</dd></dlentry>
<dlentry><dt>tgroup</dt>
<dd>Includes the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-tabletitle</synph> element
in the general rule. This is required by the “Move table/title to
table/tgroup/title” Book Build option.</dd></dlentry></dl></body></topic>
