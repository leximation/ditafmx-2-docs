<body><p>Specify search criteria of the following: textual content,
element tag name, or attribute name and attribute value. If a DITA
map has the focus, you can choose “current map” as the scope, or
you can specify a file system path.</p>

<p>The “Search For” value matches on partial strings (case sensitivity
as specified). When searching for an element tag and/or an attribute
name, the results will only provide exact matches. Providing an
attribute value can optionally match on partial strings, which is
useful for locating individual items within a filtering attribute.
You can search on the element tag or attribute name only, but if
you enter an attribute value, you must also enter the attribute
name.</p>
<p>The search results are listed in the dialog showing the topic
title and the file name. Select a file and choose Open to open the
file.</p>
<p>If the search is taking too long, pressing the Esc key (possibly
multiple times) will terminate the search.</p></body></topic>
