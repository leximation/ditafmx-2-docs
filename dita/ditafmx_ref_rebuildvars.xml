<title>Rebuild Variables</title>
<shortdesc>Rebuilds variables after conversion to a FrameMaker book.</shortdesc>

<body><p>In order to resurrect variables that have been flattened
to text by the map to book conversion process, they must have been
first processed with the <uicontrol>Prepare Variables</uicontrol> command. The <uicontrol>Rebuild
Variables</uicontrol> command locates all ph elements with a keyref
attribute value that matches the pattern of “fmvar:VARNAME”, and
replaces the content of the ph element with the variable. The variable
will added, only if a matching variable definition is found in the
file. Because of this you may need to import the variable definitions
into the file before running the <uicontrol>Rebuild Variables</uicontrol> command.</p>
<p>This can also be done automatically during the Map to Book conversion
process by selecting the <uicontrol>Rebuild Variables</uicontrol> option
in the <wintitle>Book Build Settings</wintitle> dialog found in
the <wintitle>DITA Options</wintitle> dialog.</p></body></topic>
