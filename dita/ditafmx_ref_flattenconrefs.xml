<title>Flatten Conrefs</title>
<shortdesc>Unlocks all conrefs in the active book or file.</shortdesc>

<body><p>By default, conrefs are wrapped in a locked region similar
to a text inset. While working in DITA XML files, this is typically
the desired functionality, but once a DITA file has been saved to
a FM file, it may be useful for the conrefs to be unlocked. This is
a particular issue when the conref contains embedded fm-xrefs, which
will not be clickable links in a PDF unless the conref has been
unlocked.</p>
<p>This can also be done automatically during the Map to Book conversion
process by selecting the <uicontrol>Flatten Conrefs</uicontrol> option
in the <wintitle>Book Build Settings</wintitle> dialog found in
the <wintitle>DITA Options</wintitle> dialog.</p>
<note type = "important">This command can be run on an XML file
(or a workbook of XML files), and it will flatten all conrefs. Use
caution when running this command; once the conrefs are flattened
they cannot be rebuilt.</note></body></topic>
