DITA-FMx</indexterm>DITA-FMx is made up of two plugin components,
one that provides import/export processing and one that provides
general authoring support. DITA-FMx also provides three structure
applications (DTD, EDD, template, and read/write rules files), two for
DITA topic and map authoring and one for book publishing. The EDD
and rules files have been set up to allow proper interaction with
DITA-FMx. If you want to build your own DITA structure applications,
you should clone these files and modify them as needed. For more
information see <xref href = "ditafmx_customizingapps.xml#id0837A060NHS"
