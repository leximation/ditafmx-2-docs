status = "new">fm-indexterm element</indexterm>The <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">fm-indexterm</synph> element represents
an <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph> element
as a FrameMaker marker. If the <uicontrol>indexterm to fm-indexterm</uicontrol> option
is enabled in the Options dialog, <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph> elements and any index-related
child elements are converted into the FrameMaker index marker syntax
and added to an <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-indexterm</synph> element.</p>
<p status = "changed">In order to support the <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph> to <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">fm-indexterm</synph> conversion, the
Topic and Book structure applications must have the <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-indexterm</synph> element
defined. This is a clone of the <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph> element, but is defined
as a Marker object rather than a Container. All general rules that
allow the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph> element
should also allow the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-indexterm</synph> element.
The default value of the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-indexterm</synph> element’s class
attribute should be “- topic/indexterm fmx/fm-indexterm”. The <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-indexterm</synph> marker
only supports the conversion of <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph> elements that have
the following child elements: <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph>, <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">index-see</synph>, <synph status = "new"
    outputclass = "element">index-see-also</synph>, and <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">index-sort-as</synph>.
If your DITA files use other child elements you should disable this optoin.</p>
<p status = "changed">No rules are needed to properly process the <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph> or <synph
    status = "new" outputclass = "element">fm-indexterm</synph> elements.
In fact, if you’re migrating an older structure application you
should remove the <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph> rule,
it is no longer needed.</p>
<p status = "changed">If the <uicontrol>indexterm to fm-indexterm</uicontrol> option
is disabled, <synph status = "new" outputclass = "element">indexterm</synph> elements
will open as simple container elements.</p></body></topic>
