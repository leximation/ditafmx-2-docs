*DITA-FMx 2.x documentation source.*

DITA-FMx is a plugin for Adobe FrameMaker (versions 7.2 through 2019) that provides enhanced DITA authoring and publishing support. For more information or to download a trial, [visit the leximation.com website](http://leximation.com/dita-fmx/).

- Initial commit was based on the 2.0.04 source files.
- This documentation source uses the DITA XML model

***DISCLAIMER:*** **These files should not be used as a stellar example of authoring in the DITA model. They have grown over many years (since 2007), and many markup features are used solely to test DITA-FMx features, not necessarily where appropriate.**
